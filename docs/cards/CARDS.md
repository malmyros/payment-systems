## What Are Payment Cards?

**Payment cards** are physical or virtual instruments issued by banks,
Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs), or fintechs that allow users to spend money, withdraw cash, or access funds. Cards
are central to digital payments and often come in various forms: **debit**, **credit**, **prepaid**, and **virtual cards
**.

## Key Entities in the Card Ecosystem

The **4-Corner Model** describes how transactions flow between four key entities in a card payment ecosystem.
It's commonly used in open-loop card systems (e.g., Visa, Mastercard) and helps decouple the roles of issuing and
acquiring.

### Entities Involved

| Corner         | Role                                                                         |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cardholder** | The consumer who owns and uses the payment card.                             |
| **Merchant**   | The business that accepts card payments for goods or services.               |
| **Issuer**     | The financial institution (or EMI) that issues cards to the cardholder.      |
| **Acquirer**   | The financial institution that processes payments on behalf of the merchant. |

### Additional Key Entities in the Card Payments Ecosystem

These players are not part of the 4-corner model per se, but are essential to how card transactions are processed,
cleared, and settled.

| Entity                                         | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Card Network**                               | Routes transactions between acquirers and issuers; enforces scheme rules. Examples: **Visa**, **Mastercard**, **UnionPay**, **Discover**.                                                                                                     |
| **Processor**                                  | Handles technical processing of transactions, including authorization, clearing, settlement, and sometimes dispute management. Can be issuer-side, acquirer-side, or both. Examples: **FIS**, **FISERV**, **Marqeta**, **Stripe**, **Adyen**. |
| **Gateway**                                    | Connects merchants to acquirers/processors; often manages tokenization, risk checks, and 3DS. Examples: **Checkout.com**, **Stripe**, **Adyen**, **PayPal**.                                                                                  |
| **Card Manufacturer / Personalization Bureau** | Physical card printer and chip encoder. Delivers plastic cards with branding and security features. Often used by EMIs and neobanks for outsourced production.                                                                                |

## ðŸŽ¨ Card Design & Personalization

In fintech card issuing, card artwork and design are often handled by the manufacturer (e.g., Idemia, Thales, G+D), but
the card issuer must pass a **Card Image ID** or **template ID** during the card creation request.

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                        | Example                  |
