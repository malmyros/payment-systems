# Payments

## What are payment systems?

Payment systems are an infrastructure facilitating money exchange between two parties.
They enable `2-way-flow` of payments in exchange for goods and services between the payer
and the beneficiary.

The payer and the payee in a payment system may be an individual consumer, small/medium
businesses, or corporates.
