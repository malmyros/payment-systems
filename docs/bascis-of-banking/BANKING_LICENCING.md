### De Novo

`De Novo` is derived from the Latin phrase meaning **"from the beginning"** or **"anew"**.

In the context of banking and finance, a **De Novo bank** refers to a **newly established bank** that 
has received regulatory approval to begin operations independently.

De Novo banks typically:
- Are **newly chartered institutions**, not formed by acquisition or merger.
- Undergo a **de novo period** (often 3 years) of heightened regulatory scrutiny.
- Focus on **innovation**, **niche customer segments**, or **underserved markets**.

Thus, *De Novo* signifies a **fresh start** in the banking industry â€” a bank **built from the ground up**.
